# GENESIS-1

**Generalized Evolving Neural Intelligence & Self-Improving System**

GENESIS-1 is our step-by-step AGI project. This repository will house the code, modules, and documentation that describe our journey towards building a self-improving, general-purpose artificial intelligence.

## Project Structure

- `main.py` - The main entry point of the application.
- `modules/` - Contains the different modules corresponding to the AGIâ€™s cognitive layers:
  - `perception.py` - Data ingestion and preprocessing.
  - `understanding.py` - Semantic processing and representation.
  - `reasoning.py` - Decision-making and logical inference.
  - `learning.py` - Adaptive learning and reinforcement strategies.
  - `action.py` - Execution of decisions.
  - `self_improvement.py` - Auto-modification and self-enhancement routines.
